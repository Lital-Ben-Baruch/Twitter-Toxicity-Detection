# Twitter-Toxicity-Detection

## Description

This Google Colab notebook presents a comprehensive exploration and implementation of a Twitter Toxicity Detection project. The primary objective of this project is to develop a model capable of classifying tweets as either toxic or non-toxic. We will leverage a Kaggle dataset originally created for the "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge".

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project comprises a collection of comments extracted from Wikipedia, each labeled by human raters for various types of toxic behavior, including:

- Toxic
- Severe Toxic
- Obscene
- Threat
- Insult
- Identity Hate

The dataset is divided into three main files:

1. **train.csv:** This file contains comments from the training set, each labeled with binary indicators for the mentioned types of toxicity.

2. **test.csv:** The test set contains comments for which we need to predict the toxicity probabilities. Notably, some comments in the test set were intentionally excluded from scoring to discourage manual labeling.

3. **test_labels.csv:** This file provides labels for the test data. A value of -1 indicates that the comment was not used for scoring. It's important to note that this file was added after the competition's close.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can analyze a new tweet and predict whether it contains toxic content. In other words, we aim to develop a system that can assess the potential harm of Twitter posts by classifying them into two categories: toxic or non-toxic.

Throughout this Google Colab notebook, we will follow a structured approach to:

1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Explore the data to gain insights into its characteristics.
3. Perform feature engineering and text preprocessing to prepare the data for modeling.
4. Select and implement appropriate machine learning algorithms for toxicity classification.
5. Train and fine-tune the model for optimal performance.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
7. Deploy the model for toxicity detection on new tweets.

By the end of this project, we aim to have a robust and accurate model that can assist in identifying toxic content on Twitter, contributing to a safer and more respectful online environment.
