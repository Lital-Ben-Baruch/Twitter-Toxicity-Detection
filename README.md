# Twitter-Toxicity-Detection
This Google Colab notebook presents a comprehensive exploration and implementation of a Twitter Toxicity Detection project. The primary objective of this project is to develop a model capable of classifying tweets as either toxic or non-toxic. We will leverage a Kaggle dataset originally created for the "Toxic Comment Classification Challenge".
